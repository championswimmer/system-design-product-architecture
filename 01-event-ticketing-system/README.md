# Event Ticketing System 
Like BookMyShow / Ticket Master 

## Requirements 

```
Functional Requirements: 
1. Events can be created 
2. Users can search for events 
3. Users can see seat availability for events 
4. Users can book tickets at the event 
--- 
5. See past bookings

Non-Functional Requirements: 
1. Should be able to handle 10M~100M users 
2. Should handle popular events (10M+ users trying to book it)
3. High availability of event search 
4. Consistent event booking (same seat not allocated to multiple people)
```
